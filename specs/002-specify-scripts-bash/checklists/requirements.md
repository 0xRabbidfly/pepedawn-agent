# Specification Quality Checklist: Hide Asset URLs in Card Display

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-20  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

âœ… **ALL CHECKS PASSED**

### Detailed Review:

1. **Content Quality**: Specification is written in user-focused language, no technical implementation details present
2. **Requirements**: All functional requirements are testable (e.g., "URLs must not appear", "previews must render")
3. **Success Criteria**: All criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic (e.g., "100% of responses", "message length reduction by 20%")
4. **Scenarios**: Primary scenarios cover image assets, video assets, and failure cases
5. **Edge Cases**: Addressed via "Asset preview fails to load" scenario
6. **Scope**: Clearly bounded to `/f` command only, explicitly excludes other commands
7. **No Clarifications Needed**: Feature is straightforward with clear requirements

## Notes

Specification is complete and ready for planning phase (`/speckit.plan`).
