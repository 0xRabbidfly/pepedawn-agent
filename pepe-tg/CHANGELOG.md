## [Unreleased]

## [3.10.0] - 2025-11-06

### Added
- **`/fm CARDNAME`** - Real-time dispenser query for any card (e.g., `/fm FAKEASF`)
  - Fetches live dispenser data directly from Counterparty API
  - Shows top 5 cheapest dispensers with price, availability, address, and TokenScan link
  - Supports fuzzy matching for card names (exact match, then fuzzy fallback)
  - Compact bullet-point format for easy scanning
- New `DispenserQueryService` for real-time dispenser data fetching
- New `fuzzyMatch.ts` utility module (extracted from fakeRaresCard.ts for reusability)
- Test coverage for `/fm CARDNAME` validation and card name pattern matching

### Fixed
- **Telegram link previews** - Markdown links now render properly in both DMs and group chats
  - Added `link_preview_options: { is_disabled: true }` to messageManager DM path
  - Added `link_preview_options: { is_disabled: true }` to messageManager group path
  - Fixed missing `channelType` in action callback responses
  - All `/fm` responses now properly pass `channelType` for correct message routing

### Changed
- Updated `/help` command to include new `/fm CARDNAME` usage
- Updated periodic content tips to mention live dispenser queries
- Enhanced `/fm` command parser to differentiate between numeric limits and card names

### Technical Details
- messageManager now uses modern Telegram Bot API `link_preview_options` (replaces deprecated `disable_web_page_preview`)

- Fuzzy matching utilities now shared between `/f` and `/fm` commands
