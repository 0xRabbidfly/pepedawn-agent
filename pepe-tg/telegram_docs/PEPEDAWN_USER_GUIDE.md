## üé® Example Conversations

### Learning About the Genesis

**You:** "What makes FREEDOMKEK special?"

**PEPEDAWN:** "FREEDOMKEK is literally where it all began! üî•

This was the FIRST official Fake Rare, dropped by Rare Scrilla in 2021 after he got banned from the Rare Pepe Telegram for sharing a 'fake' Pepe. Instead of staying down, he turned that L into the biggest W - started the whole Fake Rares movement.

FREEDOMKEK symbolizes the core ethos: artistic freedom over gatekeeping, creativity over rules, community over everything..."
