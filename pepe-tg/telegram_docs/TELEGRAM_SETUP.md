## How Commands Work

### BotFather Commands (UI Only)
- Show in Telegram's autocomplete menu
- Help users discover features
- Purely cosmetic/UX enhancement
- Don't affect bot logic

### ElizaOS Actions (Actual Logic)
- Process the actual commands
- Execute the bot's functionality
- Handle validation and responses
- Already implemented in your code

**They work together perfectly!**
