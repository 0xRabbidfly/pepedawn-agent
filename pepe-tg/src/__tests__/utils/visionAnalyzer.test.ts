/**
 * Vision Analyzer Utility Tests
 * 
 * Note: The visionAnalyzer utility is tested indirectly through integration tests.
 * Direct unit testing requires complex OpenAI SDK mocking which is not well
 * supported in Bun's test runner.
 * 
 * See integration tests in:
 * - fakeVisualCommand.test.ts (12 tests)
 * - fakeTestCommand.test.ts (17 tests)
 * - visual-commands.test.ts (20+ tests)

    // - fakeTestCommand.test.ts (tests /ft command which uses visionAnalyzer)
    // - visual-commands.test.ts (tests plugin routing to both commands)

    // which is complex with Bun's test runner. The integration tests provide
    // comprehensive coverage of all critical paths.
