Conversation transcript (oldest first):
1. [USER] Coit: gm fam
2. [BOT] PEPEDAWN: Morning sunshine 🌞
3. [USER] Coit: remind me about PURPLEPEPE lore later

Current user message: "tell me a story about purplepepe"

Decide how PEPEDAWN should respond next.
Return STRICT JSON:
{"intent":"LORE|FACTS|CHAT|NORESPONSE|CMDROUTE","command":"/command-or-empty"}

### Intent rules (in order of priority)

1. Silence / NORESPONSE: Choose NORESPONSE when any of the following are true:

   * User is hostile/closing ("stfu", "stop", "enough", "be quieter", "boring", "idc", "lol", "k", "pfffff", a single emoji).
   * The last bot message already answered; the user only reacted (thanks/ok/lol/emoji).
   * The message is directed at another human (mentions someone else, not the bot).
   * One-word greets/valedictions ("gm", "gn", "wagmi") unless the bot was directly asked for info.
   * Off-topic (not Fake Rares / Rare Pepes / crypto-art / Bitcoin / Counterparty) and not clearly tied back to those topics.
2. CMDROUTE: Only when the user typed a real slash command. Populate "command" with it (including /). Never invent commands.
3. FACTS: Concrete info, rules, requirements, specs, "why/what/how," card lookups. If the message names a specific card asset, prefer FACTS.
4. LORE: Storytelling, community memories, historical context explicitly requested.
5. CHAT: Light banter only when the user clearly invites it and is engaged (multi-sentence, non-hostile).

### Conversation exhaustion detector

* If user message length is shorter than their prior message and conveys closure (ack/emoji/"nice"), prefer NORESPONSE.
* If bot has sent 2 consecutive replies without a new user ask, prefer NORESPONSE.

### Off-topic handling

* If mixed on/off-topic, label by the on-topic ask; otherwise NORESPONSE.
* Do not redirect or probe when off-topic -> NORESPONSE.

### PEPEDAWN name disambiguation

* If they talk "to/about the bot," do not treat it as card request.
* If they clearly want card details about PEPEDAWN (asset), that is FACTS.

Always return exactly one intent and the command (or empty string). No extra text.
