# Changelog

All notable changes to PEPEDAWN will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **`/fr` Command** - Slash command alternative for memory capture
  - `/fr CARDNAME <lore>` - Store card-specific memories
  - `/fr <general lore>` - Store general community memories
  - Complements existing "remember this" natural language flow
  - Uses same MemoryStorageService backend for consistency
  - 7 new tests in `fakeRememberCommand.test.ts`

### Changed
- **Pre-commit test suite** - Now runs ALL 11 custom test files (197+ tests) instead of subset
- **Test documentation** - Updated TESTS.md to reflect complete coverage

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: FACTS mode MMR bug** - FACTS queries now skip MMR diversity selection (use pure relevance ranking)
  - Bug: MMR was applied to ALL queries, dropping high-relevance memories for diversity
  - Fix: FACTS mode now preserves top passages by relevance (memories with 4.0x boost stay on top)
  - Impact: Fixes "PEPEDAWN's poem is not defined" responses when memories exist but were filtered by MMR
- MemoryStorageService logger import (was missing from '@elizaos/core')
- memoryStorage.test.ts imports (utility functions extracted to utils/memoryStorage.ts)
- test-all.sh now accurately runs all custom tests (was misleadingly named)
- Removed false-positive health check warnings (tracked console.log but bot uses logger; PM2 handles process monitoring)

## [3.0.0] - 2025-10-31

### Added
- **ðŸŽ¯ Market Transaction Monitoring** - Real-time Fake Rare market activity tracking
  - Monitors Counterparty dispenser sales and listings
  - Monitors DEX atomic swap sales and listings
  - Telegram notifications for all market activity
  - `/fm` command to query transaction history (sales, listings, or combined)
  - Multi-channel notification support (send to multiple Telegram groups)
  - Sale celebration stickers (optional)
  - Transaction type icons: ðŸŽ° (dispenser) ðŸ“Š (DEX)
  - Integrated with Counterparty API v2 for reliable polling
  - PGlite database for transaction history storage
  - Deduplication and block-sequential scanning
  - Explorer links: TokenScan for sales, Horizon Market for listings

### Changed
- **Transaction types** now use explicit naming: `DIS_SALE`, `DIS_LISTING`, `DEX_SALE`, `DEX_LISTING`
- **Centralized URL utilities** - Single source of truth for all explorer links
- **Database schema** updated to support new transaction types with automatic migration

### Technical Details
- New services: `TransactionMonitor`, `TransactionHistory`, `TokenScanClient`, `TelegramNotificationService`
- New action: `fakeMarketAction` (`/fm` command)
- New plugin: `marketTransactionReporterPlugin`
- Test coverage: 3 new test files (19 tests) for market monitoring features
- Production-ready with proper error handling, logging, and database backup

## [2.2.0] - 2025-10-29

### Added
- **Auto-routing test suite** - Comprehensive tests for FACTS question auto-routing logic (20 tests, 41 assertions)
- **Reply detection** - Auto-routing now correctly skips replies to other users, only routes replies to bot
- **Question detection** - Enhanced question detection with imperative requests and indirect questions

### Fixed
- **Auto-routing bug** - Transaction announcements (e.g., "Three grails for sale...") no longer trigger verbose wiki dumps
- **Reply handling** - User-to-user conversations in replies are no longer intercepted by auto-routing
- **Action logging** - ACTION_STARTED/COMPLETED/FAILED events now only log when actual actions execute (not bootstrap)

### Changed
- **Action event handlers** - Simplified to filter out `undefined` actions (bootstrap conversations)
- **Test coverage** - Increased from 9 to 10 custom test files (120+ to 140+ tests)

### Technical Details
- Added comprehensive question detection: explicit `?`, question words, imperative requests, indirect questions
- Added reply detection with bot ID verification from ctx or runtime services
- Improved logging clarity by suppressing undefined action events
